                <p>Carissa was born in Washington, she and her family then moved to Arizona and she 
                        currently lives in California.  She currently works as an optometry assistant, a profession she just fell into when working as a medical assistant.  
                        She has been helping people see a better world for over eleven years.    When she is not working, she loves to travel.  When she is traveling, 
                        she is usually accompanied by her other half, Patric.  One of the reasons for her travels is to attend different conventions in different cities.  
                        She attends comic book conventions, anime conventions, and even horror conventions, even though that is not her favorite.  
                        Carissa hopes to finally get to New York to attend New York Comic Con.  She is in the middle of planning for that right now.  She is an avid 
                        collector of Funko Pops and has close to 600 in her collection.  Her favorites right now are her Green Chrome Batman from ECCC, Selena Grammy Dress, and BTS Dynamite 7 pack.  
                        Movies are another favorite of hers and her top three favorite movies are Breakfast at Tiffanyâ€™s, West Side Story (1961), and The Wizard of Oz.  Combining all of her 
                        interests into one, she and her boyfriend have a YouTube channel and a podcast that cover all of these topics, both of which are titled Tomorrow 
                        Comes Movies.  They delve into how they found their Funko Pops and where they have gotten them from.  They talk about all the movies they see 
                        as they both used to work in a movie theater, and that is how their story together began.  And their big topic is usually which convention they 
                        have just attended, what Funko Pops they found there, what celebrities they met and any news that may have come from the convention.  
                        One thing that they really do not discuss is music, which she would love to add as a good song can set her mood.  They have travelled all 
                        over to attend comic book conventions, but of all the conventions they have attended her favorite so far is Emerald City Comic Con, ECCC, in Seattle. 
                        One moment that Carissa is particularly proud is that they were able to receive an early screener for a movie that was one of their favorite anime
                        shows.  This is impressive as they are a smaller media production with a smaller audience than those that normally receive the screeners.</p>
